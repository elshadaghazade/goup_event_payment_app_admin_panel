# GOUP EVENT PAYMENT APP ADMIN PANEL (DJANGO)

This project utilizes Django 5.0.4 to automatically generate an admin panel based on an existing database schema. This allows for robust, web-based management of event data directly via Django's dynamic admin interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- Python (3.9 or newer)
- PostgreSQL
- pip and virtualenv (recommended for Python package management)

## Installation

### Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository to get started with the Django admin panel project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
cd your-project
```

### Setting Up the Environment

#### Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

#### Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install Django 5.0.4 along with any other necessary libraries as defined in your **requirements.txt** file.

### Database Configuration

Configure your PostgreSQL database settings in settings.py:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'your_database_name',
        'USER': 'your_database_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_database_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

### Running Migrations

Ensure that your database structure is up to date with the current application models:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Creating an Admin User

Create a superuser to access the Django admin interface:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to set the username, email, and password.

### Running the Server

Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin to access the Django admin site and log in with your superuser credentials.

### Using the Admin Panel

Once logged in, you'll be able to manage all models registered in the Django admin. This includes adding, modifying, and deleting records as well as utilizing any custom admin features specified in your project.

### Further Customization

**Custom Admin Interfaces**: Consider adding or modifying admin.py files in your Django apps to customize how models are displayed in the admin.
**Security Enhancements**: Always ensure your Django settings are configured for security, especially in production environments (e.g., using HTTPS, setting SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True, etc.).
